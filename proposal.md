Knights and Dungeons

Repository -

Description -
For this final project, I aim to create a platform game within VS Code using Python as its primary programming language. It is relevant to digital arts & media as it incorporates both the artistic and technical attributes to build and compose the game.  

Features -
The platform will feature a controllable player character with movement capabilities (right, left, and jumping), as well as the ability to collect items and engage in combat and evasion against enemies. 
This will require solving camera movement, tile maps, and sprite animations for the player character as well as other NPCS.

Challenges - 
- Collision detection 
- Gravity physics
- Multiple game screens (main menu, game level, and "game over" screen).
- sprite movement animations 
- game loops & frame rates
- level designs 
- environmental effects
- sound design


Outcomes - 

a. Ideal Outcome -
The Final game includes a fully functional level with a playable knight character, enemies to fight, collectible items, and a pixel-art dungeon environment with background ambience and music. It feels like a small, nostalgic fantasy platformer inspired by Dungeons & Dragons adventures.

b. Minimal Viable Outcome - 
A working demo where the player knight can move, jump across platforms, and interact with at least one enemy or collectible item. The visuals capture the retro D&D atmosphere, even if not all features (like combat or sound) are fully completed.
