Description - 
Knights and Dungeons is a retro-platform game that is aesthetically inspired by Dungeons and Dragons and Final Fantasy. In this game, your goal is to escape the dungeon while slaying the hostile skeletons that bar your way of escape. You must collect 5 key's to achieve victory. The movement consists of your right and left arrow keys, (double) spacebar to (double) jump, and X to attack your enemies. Player health is low and consists of 3 hearts. This is a quick and easy platformer that displays both the artistic and technical aspects of this final project.
